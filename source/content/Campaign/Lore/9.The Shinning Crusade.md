# **The Shinning Crusade**

![[Shining crusades.png]]

### Events
The Shining Crusade was a decades-long war fought by Alonia, the dwarves of the Kingdom of Kraggodan, the Kenay and the Knights of Tirion against the forces of the Whispering Tyrant. It began in 3754 AR and ended with the Tyrant's defeat and imprisonment in 3827 AR and the founding of the country of Y’Falin the following year.

### History

In the 9th century AR, the wizard-king Tar-Baphon terrorised central Ailira. An immensely powerful necromancer, he followed the strictures of the Whispering Way, longing for immortality through undeath. He and his undead minions were so powerful that it took the power of the god Aroden himself to finally defeat him. In a mighty battle, the Last Azlanti slew the tyrant in 896 AR.

Nothing was heard of the wizard-king for thousands of years, and all who even remembered the name Tar-Baphon believed him to be long dead and wasted away. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Through the power of his magic, he was reborn as a lich in 3203 AR, now calling himself the Whispering Tyrant. Gathering his undead followers, he travelled north into Shaog Blar. There he unified the quarrelling orc tribes by promising them the riches of the southern lands of central Ailira. By the end of that year, they had conquered what is today Y’Falin and brought its people under Tar-Baphon's control. He consolidated his rule over the next 600 years from the capital city of Highhelm.
