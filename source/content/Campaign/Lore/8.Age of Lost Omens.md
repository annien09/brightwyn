### Events

The Age of Lost Omens is one of the seven major historical ages of Brightwyn, the beginnings and ends of which are marked by globally-significant events. It is the age in which we find ourselves today, having supplanted the Age of Enthronement in 4606 AR when the death of the god Aroden threw the entire world into decades of turmoil and confusion.

 Aroden himself had prophesied thousands of years before that he would return on the cusp of mankind's greatest triumph and usher in the Age of Glory. His priests and followers calculated the supposed exact time of this event and prepared for it with lavish pomp. On the prophesied date, instead of his return, all contact to the god was lost and the world was devastated by terrible storms, the opening of vast planar rifts, and decades-spanning political upheavals. Since then, no major prophecy has come true, a condition for which historians have named the current era.

 A demon-haunted wasteland in the northern-most reaches of central Ailira, the Worldwound is an unnatural blight: a planar tear to the Abyss that opened on the Material Plane. It appeared shortly after the death of the god Aroden at the beginning of the Age of Lost Omens, and is probably the greatest threat to life on the face of Brightwyn.

 The Eye of Abendego is a vicious, permanent hurricane located in the southern Malmer Sea off the south-eastern coast of Alonia and south of the Shackles. The Eye appeared in 4606 AR, and although the exact cause of its appearance is unknown, it came into being after three weeks of tempest following the death of Aroden, and remains as the greatest physical evidence of the event.
