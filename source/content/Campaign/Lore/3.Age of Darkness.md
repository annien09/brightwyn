#  **Age of Darkness**

![[Age of Darkness.png]]

### Events
The world was plunged into the Age of Darkness with the destruction brought by the Earthfall, the star brought down to destroy the Azlantian empire. In the wake of the catastrophe the majority of the elves used portals to retreat to their home world in case their plan to save the world would fail. They designated a certain number of the population to stay behind to create bubbles of magic to preserve parts of the forest and the wilds. Some spread around in an attempt to stop the world from falling into the sea, having to deal with the consequences of an entire continent sinking. They managed to stop a part of the world from being wiped out by gigantic waves and flooding. What remained of the world was viewed as a great victory, thus giving the world its new name, Brightwyn.

The impact of the Earthfall knocked ash into the atmosphere, which started spreading and blocking the sun. It was due to the remaining elves that the darkness did not spread to the remaining world, instead it was contained to one area. The toxic atmosphere ensured that the land started to rot and the elves who could not leave without allowing the darkness to spread were changed by the absence of the sun, their skin becoming darker, their eyes adapting to the absence of light, giving birth to a new race, the drow.

Meanwhile, the massive tremors sent through the layers of the planet caused by the Earthfall made the dwarves, who lived underground for ages, start their journey to reach the surface. They took the events as a sign of the prophecy given to them by Torag, the dwarven god. The prophecy said that when the ground shook beneath their feet, they must press upwards to the sky. It took them over 300 years, years of infighting and rebellions to complete their journey.

On their journey to the sky, the dwarves battled their ancient enemies, the orcs, who, prompted by the dwarven ascension, started finding their own way to the surface. They managed to reach their destination before the dwarves, only two decades after they started.

Upon completion of the Quest for Sky, the dwarves established massive city-like fortresses known as Sky Citadels.
