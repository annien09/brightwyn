#  **Age of Anguish**

![[Age of Anguish.png]]

### Events

During the Age of Darkness the Azlantian Kingdom saw its end, but a few survivors migrated to the other corners of the remaining world. It was there where they integrated with the rest of the human race and used their knowledge to advance, giving birth to different other civilizations.

Meanwhile, the Ancient Elves lay grounds in the areas they helped saving and started different societies. The Kingdom of Tirion and Cai Edhil were born. The first became the kingdom of the High Elves, while the second one, populated by elves who over time adapted to their environment, became known as the kingdom of the Wood Elves. In the area of The Diamond Mountains, the Grey Elves made their home, while in The Crown of the World, the elves who decided to remain there adapted to the cold and harsh environment, becoming the Snow Elves.

During this age the dwarves expanded their reach on the surface in Y'Falin, forming trade agreements with the elves. Their desire for conquest and their leaders' hunger for gold and other precious metals lead them to try and conquer the nation known today as Shaog Blar, rekindling the conflict with their old enemies, the orcs who settled in that area.

The Jistka Imperium, known today as the Teseon Empire was the first major human kingdom established after the devastation of the Earthfall. Genie-binding magistrates and golem-crafting artificers dominated the Jistka Imperium, jockeying amongst themselves for power. Those internal struggles ultimately ended when the rising powers of the nearby kingdoms of Oshad and the Imperial Lung-Wa started threatening their sovereignty.

It was one of the magistrates that changed the world forever, united the two factions under one banner, and self-proclaimed himself Emperor Vhrentmane. He was the first human magistrate to discover the existence of dragons, one of the first denizens of the world, slumbering underground for eons. Vhrentmane not only managed to wake the red dragon Seirissaen, one of the avatars of the evil dragon goddess Tiamat, but bind him to his will.

For twenty-seven years Seirissaen, later known as the Scar of the East, served as a slave without chains to Vhrentmane. The entirety of the eastern part of the continent of Ailira all feared the tyrant and knew not to tread near his domain, for the dragon was his weapon and he its vicious will. The Emperor used his newfound power against the Ancient Osirion and parts of Oshad and Allanar. The Eastlands burned for nearly three decades, until the night Vhrentmane's palace fell prey to a brazen thief who stole away the Emperor's Ruby Orb of the Dragonkin which he used to bend Seirissaen to his will. That night, fire touched the sky as it so often did, but it was the Emperor who burned. No other has come forth with such great power to use the orb again, and it is said that it was lost to the ages. The ancient dragon's breath was so hot that the area affected became a desert.

Meanwhile, up North, Ancient Norggheim, although in its early years, advanced rapidly from barbarism into civilization. The nation soon became both a cultural and a military success. During this age though, the Jistka Imperium was the most powerful human nation. The newer nation suffered for hundreds of years under foreign domination, even after Emperor Vhrentmane found his demise.
