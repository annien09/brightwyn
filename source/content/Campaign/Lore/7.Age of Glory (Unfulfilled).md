# **Age of Glory (Unfulfilled)**

![[age of glory.png]]

### Events


The Age of Glory was the time of the prophesied return of the god Aroden to Brightwyn. According to the Starfall Doctrine, it was supposed to have begun in 4606 AR, but instead of the god of humanity's return, his priests lost their divine connection and he is presumed to have perished. Instead of humans being led into a new golden age of peace and justice that Brightwyn hadn't witnessed since the height of ancient Azlanti, the world was plunged into decades of chaos and the Age of Lost Omens.

 The rulers of Oshad at the end of the Age of Enthronement put great stock in the prophecies of the Starfall Doctrine, believing that Aroden would return to Brightwyn and lead their nation into a new era of peace and justice. Believing the Starfall Doctrine gave them a divine mandate, the people of Oshad grew proud, and worked for hundreds of years to increase their wealth, power, and glory. King Gaspodar himself prepared in 4605 AR to give up the crown to the returned god. When Aroden died, it plunged Oshad into a terrible civil war. Without their patron god to guide them, some of them looked elsewhere for support, and finally found it in the Order of the Children of the Light.

 Other orders born with the dead of Aroden are the Harbingers and the Deskari cultists.
