# **Age of Destiny**

![[Age of Destiny.png]]

### Events

The Age of Destiny (-3470 AR – 1 AR) began with the founding of the Osiriani civilization and spanned three and a half millennia until Aroden raised the Starstone from the bottom of the inner seas and founded the great city of Absalom, ushering in the Age of Enthronement.

It was marked by the re-emergence of human civilization after the barbarism of the Age of Darkness and the Age of Anguish. Other notable occurrences included the founding of Alonia and of Norggheim. 

Wars during this age included the Nex–Geb War and the tarrasque invasion of -632 AR.
