# Age of Creation

## Events
It is said that the world used to be much bigger, but most of history is either forgotten or lost. Today most traces of the old world are unknown, including its name. All that is remembered is through the accounts of the old races, long lost artefacts that occasionally resurface or visions granted by the gods.

It is said, and eternally debated, that the Primeval World was populated by mysterious races who lived for millennia and made not only the land habitable, but both the air and the sea. Yet, with a recorded history spanning over 15,000 years, Brightwyn has seen the rise and fall of a multitude of civilizations. Many who study history find that these bygone societies left much of value, whether those benefits take the form of ancient traditions, forgotten religions, powerful relics, spellcraft techniques, or simply lessons learned from the failures that ultimately led to a civilization's fall.

At their peak, a few of the ancient civilizations learned the secrets to ascend to godhood, and some became powerful enough to do so. Initially, all who achieved that status used their powers to aid those in need and improve their lives, but soon enough evil deities arose who oppose those with good intentions. History and religion tell us that eons ago these Divine beings fought against each other in order to either protect or enslave the world and its inhabitants. An alliance of good gods and goddesses lead by Sarenrae, the goddess of Sun, fought and imprisoned the god Rovagug, whose purpose was to destroy creation and the other gods. Sarenrae cut open the world and sealed Rovagug in its core, and the archdevil Asmodeus provided a lock and key capable of imprisoning a god, a key that only the Prince of Darkness holds.

That was the last time the deities made themselves known to mortals before making a pact amongst themselves and exiling themselves into the Great Beyond in order to protect the world.
