## ⛪ The Divine Pantheon

The gods are real. They grant power and insight, though some seem more distant than they once were. You can find more on each in **Deities**, including:

- **[[Pharasma]]**: Birth, death, and fate.
    
- **[[Cayden Cailean]]**: Ale, bravery, freedom (and hangovers).
    
- **[[Nethys]]**: Magic in all its duality.
    
-  [[Aroden]], [[Calistria]], [[Sarenrae ]] [[Norgorber]], [[Rovagug]], [[Urgathoa]] and more upcoming.
    

Your character may worship, fear, study or be indifferent to them, but their influence touches nearly every corner of the world.

## 🌍 Where You Are: The Teseon Empire

You are a citizen or visitor in **[[Teseon]]**, the empire of knowledge and arcane might.

### 🌐 Government

Teseon is governed by the **Council of Three and Nine**:

- The **Three** are the true power:
    
    - **Archmage Devati Vilicus** – leader of the Arclords
        
    - **Iranez of the Orb** – a mighty witch and seer
        
    - **Elder Architect Oblosk** – master of Inazzur’s Hold
        
- The **Nine** are leaders of magical, mercantile, and religious factions across the empire. More info on them in the Nation file.
    

They argue, conspire and shape the world’s future from high towers and sealed council chambers.

### ⚙️ History

The Empire rose from the ashes of **Jistka Imperium**, a post-Earthfall civilization of magic and constructs. It is deeply tied to the arcane, from massive magical universities to cities layered in ley lines and ancient secrets.

The current story takes place in **[[Ilayas]]**, the sixth-largest city in Teseon. Nestled between the shimmering **Tamlem Lake** and the vast **Wynsend Forest**, Ilayas is divided into six districts, each alive with its own culture.
