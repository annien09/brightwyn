# **Age of Enthronement**

![[Age of Enthronement.png]]

### Events

The Age of Enthronement began with the founding of Absalom, and its inception is also the starting point for the Absalom Reckoning (AR) calendar system. The Age of Enthronement spans the years from 1 AR until 4606 AR when Aroden, the God of Humanity, died.

 This age is characterized by the emergence of a number of Gods who ascended to divinity through the Test of the Starstone. Gods to survive the test are Aroden in 1 AR, Norgorber in 1893 AR, Cayden Cailean in 2765 AR and Iomedae in 3832 AR.

The Teseon Empire and The Kingdom of Oshad were founded as expansions from the Jistka Imperium.

The Oath Wars raged across northeast Ailira between 2498 AR and 2560 AR as the churches of Nethys, Norgorber and Sarenrae vied for dominance.

The Whispering Tyrant arose in 3203 AR invoking the Vindex Order in 3754 AR which burned for three quarters of a century and ended with the founding of Y'Falin to defend against the return of the lich king.
