### Events

After the gods left the mortal realm, the protection of the world fell to the most advanced races. The first inhabitants of the world after the disappearance of the gods were the fey.

The fey were not of this world but rather crossed over from the First World, and remained to look over this one, binding themselves to its rules of mortality and decay, thus giving up their immortality. The fey tasked themselves to not only restoring and bringing balance to the world after the destruction sought by Rovagug, but also to exploring it and discovering its secrets.

They discovered many ancient and mysterious races which are now forgotten, and amongst those discoveries numbered a race similar to theirs, at least in their desire to live in balance with the wild and understand it better, the elves. It was during this age that the two coexisted peacefully and became comfortable with the forest’s many connections to the First World.

As the elven population grew, they explored past where their fey friends, who stayed connected to the nature, advanced, reaching other corners of the world. In their exploration they discovered other sentient and civilized races who preferred to stay secluded.

One of those races, the aquatic algollthus, is said to have given life to the humans. Furthermore, they took a special interest into the Azlanti humans, with whom they began experimenting, raising them from barbarism and teaching them their control over magic. They used illusions to disguise themselves and walk amongst humanity in the role of powerful wizards. As the alghollthus nurtured the Empire of Azlant, they also secretly spread their own power through its ascendancy, making the Azlanti the first and arguably the greatest of the human civilizations.

The empire of Tassilon rose near the end of the age founded by exiles from Azlant and ruled by wizards known as Runelords. They found out about the manipulation of the alghollthus, who decided to use magic so powerful that it brought down a star to destroy Azlant, and with it any traces of their involvement. With the cataclysm deemed today as the Earthfall they managed to wipe out both human empires and the vast majority of the continent.
