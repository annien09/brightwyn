</div> <h2 class="wiki-lead-heading">Overview</h2>

Improck has a tradition of governance through democratic council that stretches all the way back to its founding, when Lamond Breachton helped create the town’s charter and officiated its first governmental vote. Back then, the wizard took a vote of the outpost’s people, allowing them to vote for three candidates they believed would best serve their interests in a decision-making capacity. In the town’s very first election, the top three vote recipients—Veraline Rhasolde, Agabe Owu, and Tilda Halversson—became Improck’s first town councilors, with Veraline Rhasolde becoming council president by virtue of receiving the most votes overall.
<div class="clear"></div>

Every 2 years, the town holds a new election under those strictly democratic terms, with the top vote receivers landing spots on the council. This tradition has persisted for six generations, though the number of council seats has swelled to five, given the town’s far larger current population, and its councilors have included every ancestry that has called the region home, from dwarves to elves to half-elves to half-orcs to goblins to even a few with more uncommon ancestries.

In addition to its municipal duties, the town council is also responsible for overseeing and paying the members of Improck’s town guard, which typically consists of about 50 members. Currently, the head of the town guard is Wilford Lavendil (LG male half-elf soldier), a jolly yet militaristic man whose human mother’s family traces its heritage to a founding pioneer. The town guard concerns itself with crimes committed inside the town limits, and it regularly patrols around the perimeter roads for active, large-scale threats to the town’s peace. However, limited as the guard’s personnel is, there is much that falls outside of the organization’s purview, including small threats to travelers on nearby roads, crimes committed against citizens outside the town’s limits, and petty anonymous crimes that don’t actively threaten citizens’ safety. For these jobs, the town council regularly employs trusted adventurers to keep the peace and help its residents feel safe and happy.

Improck's leaders hire adventurers for three main purposes. First, it provides the townspeople with an official way to obtain help when they’ve exhausted all other options. Second, it allows the salaried town guard to focus on mundane crimes and threats to the town. And third, it provides experience to local adventurers and allows the council to vet out-of-town mercenaries, so that if the need arises again, the town will have  heroes ready to come to its aid.

### Current Council

The council’s current members are listed below.

Greta Gardania (LG female human councilor): The daughter of one of the most prominent families in Improck, Greta Gardania traces her lineage to one of Improck's founders, Rennold Gardania. From a very young age Greta passionately aspired to public service, tirelessly studying the town’s civic history and diving into every text she could find about the philosophy and strategies of governance.

Jorsk Hinterclaw (NG male dwarf councilor): The son of silver miners from Kraggodan, Jorsk was a smith’s apprentice in his hometown before he left for a life of adventure. He traveled all around the region completing various jobs with crews of mostly kind-hearted adventurers, and he garnered a very positive reputation in Improck long before he settled there and began to dabble in public service.

Quentino Posandi (N male human councilor): One of the most inscrutable members of Improck's town council, Quentino Posandi is nonetheless the owner of one of the most successful businesses in town, the Posandi Bros. masonry company. Quentino is the business’s fifth-generation owner and manages it himself, and despite the significance of handling those tasks alone, the business has never thrived more. Out of all the council members, Quentino speaks the least, but when he does weigh in publicly on a decision, his shrewdness and problem-solving ability are remarkable.

Melma Ann Sendari (LN female human councilor): The scion of an Oshadian family who moved fled their homeland, Melma Ann carries the pedigree of old nobility whose legacy ended with the political upheaval of the Oshadian Civil War. Nonetheless, she carries herself with impressive self-assurance, and she understands diplomacy and statesmanship better than perhaps any other politician on the council.

Trini Sprizzlegig (CG female gnome councilor): Trini Sprizzlegig is a first-generation resident of Improck. Trini is a deeply kind and empathetic woman, if a little manic, and her propensity for helping others led her to earn a spot on the council. Perhaps one of its flightiest members, Trini nonetheless is one of its staunchest voices for helping those in need—and for welcoming adventurers from far-off locales or unusual backgrounds.

## Points of Interest
### Town Hall

In addition to the chamber used for Improck's public meetings—including town council meetings and the Call for Heroes—the Town Hall includes the offices of all staff members who support the town’s government and its myriad municipal functions, as well as its town guard and courts.

### Monument Circle

This marble-paved circle is the visual centerpiece of Improck. Around it stand six deep wells that the nearby residents and businesses rely on for fresh water. In the center of the ring is an elegant, 15-foot-tall bronze statue of the wizard Lamond Breachton, Improck's founder and the town’s most important historical figure.

### Market Square

 As you step into the bustling square, your senses are immediately captivated by the lively atmosphere and an array of sights, sounds, and scents that fill the air.

The marketplace is a mosaic of vibrant colors and eclectic sounds, a tapestry of stalls and storefronts lining cobblestone streets. Canopies stretch overhead, offering shade and shelter from the elements, while pennants flutter in the breeze, adding a touch of whimsy to the scene.

The aroma of freshly baked pastries and aromatic spices wafts through the air, enticing visitors with a symphony of delectable scents. The town's skilled bakers proudly display their golden-crusted loaves of bread, flaky pastries, and mouthwatering treats. Nearby, herb vendors arrange an assortment of dried herbs and vibrant flowers, their fragrances intermingling and filling the senses.

Stalls burst with colorful displays of fruits and vegetables, each one meticulously arranged to showcase their freshness and abundance. Plump, juicy berries glisten in the sunlight, while ripe melons emit a sweet perfume. Farmers proudly present their yields, inviting patrons to taste the succulent flavors of the land.

### Wizard's Grace

The Wizard’s Grace tavern is the favored establishment of many adventurers who wish to seek work from the council in the town’s monthly Call for Heroes. Here, adventurers and municipal workers regularly mingle, exchanging stories and generally enjoying the atmosphere created by the diverse clientele. In the days leading up to each council meeting, the tavern is particularly busy, as adventurers schmooze with town officials and even the occasional council member who might show up for a drink and a meal. Before each meeting, the inn’s tavern has a long-standing tradition of holding toasts and serving meals of boar stew with lentils—a practice owner Trinil Uskwold (NG female human innkeeper) highly encourages, as her grandfather, himself a prominent local adventurer, loved eating that meal before embarking on his own many daring journeys. Because of the politics of socializing here, the crowd tends to be both well-mannered and chatty, though occasionally a brash adventurer or two gets rowdy.

### Cayden's Keg

This rousing, well-kept tavern is one of Improck's most popular places to enjoy a hearty meal and a pint of ale, and it doubles as a temple of Cayden Cailean. The proprietor, primary bartender, and head priestess is Brynne Taithe (CG female human cleric of Cayden Cailean 5), who loves little more than when adventurers tell rousing tales of their daring exploits and deeds, preferably in conjunction with frequent purchases of ale. The priestess particularly loves when a good story holds the entire tavern rapt, and she has been known to provide entire rounds on the house when that happens as an offering to her god. It’s also a good business practice, though, since a captivated and tipsy audience is usually willing to purchase more food and ale as the evening progresses.

### Improck Lumber

This facility on the edge of the Wynsend Woods serves as a logging mill and a carpenter's shop. The business provides lumber for much of the town’s construction needs and regularly sends contingents of lumberjacks into the nearby wood—though the aggressive boars, cougars, and even wargs and owlbears often make this a dangerous prospect. As a result, chief logging forewoman Narine Howerdell (N female half-elf lumberjack) often hires adventurers to accompany these contingents. Payment might come in the form of gold pieces, choice selections of lumber, or wood worked into graceful furniture or other pieces in the carpentry shop attached to the mill. The shop enjoys a reputation as employing some of the best artisans in Improck; the eccentric Xandel Rynearsohn (CG male human carpenter) oversees it.

### Crimson Wood Furs

Despite the specificity of its name, Crimson Wood Furs is a comprehensive haberdashery known for its high-end tailoring, gorgeous cold-weather outerwear, and fine cobbling. The establishment takes pride in its origins as a luxury supplier to high-ranking Hellknights, and portraits of early Order leaders wearing the shop’s fine clothes line the store’s mahogany walls.

Current owner and chief tailor Winthrop Finney (NG male human tailor) is a relative newcomer to Improck, having moved here from Ephesus as a very young man, but he is passionate about his craft and about outfitting his customers in exquisite finery. Winthrop began working at Crimson Wood Furs more than a dozen years ago and worked his way up the business’s ranks until he eventually purchased the operation from the previous owner. He is particularly impressed by self-made adventurers, and he can be convinced to offer discounts or even free articles to adventurers who promise to publicly and prominently wear his clothes and speak highly of his wares.

### The Great Dreamhouse

One of the few dedicated temples in Improck, the Great Dreamhouse is a monastery-like establishment dedicated to the goddess Desna. About 30 priests and acolytes call the place home, living, working, studying, and praying in the temple’s peaceful lounges and verdant indoor gardens. The Great Dreamhouse offers a place for weary travelers of all stripes to rest, and most of its resident faithful are willing to provide healing at a reasonable price. On clear nights in the summer, head priest Kellen Carondil (CG male elf cleric of Desna 5) invites the public into the temple’s observatory to gaze at the stars and ponder the callings of the goddess of travelers.

### Lamond's Lament

Located in one of the most hardscrabble parts of Improck, Lamond’s Lament is a soup kitchen and place for the downtrodden to rest. The operation is funded through a mix of public money and donations, and its staff consists of volunteers from throughout the community. Council President Greta Gardania once worked here and administrated its operations. Since she joined the town council, oversight of Lamond’s Lament has fallen to Renatta Gilroy (LG female human chef), a quiet but deeply kind woman who often helps guests of the operation at her own personal expense.

### Morta's Mortuary

This imposing, black-painted building with heavy onyx-colored curtains serves as the home and place of business for Morta Valaskin (N female human mortician), an eccentric woman whose daily fashions include elaborate mourning gowns, gauzy black veils, and elbow-length satin gloves. Morta views death as both a business and a lifestyle. Though her flighty mannerisms and morbid outlook toward funerals and the dead might seem macabre, to Morta, death is just a part of life, and a fascinating one at that. Naturally, Morta worships Pharasma, the Lady of Graves, so various images of psychopomps—particularly the birdlike nosoi—decorate the mortuary in the form of paintings, sconces, floor statues, and the like. Morta is also one of most informed gossips about town, and she knows the secrets of everyone from prominent citizens to ordinary townsfolk.

### Pickled Ear

This rough-and-tumble dive bar and tavern is frequented by locals and hardscrabble adventurers alike—many of whom clash in rowdy and sometimes vicious brawls that take place far too regularly for the town guard’s liking. Proprietor Roxie Denn (CN female human tavernkeeper) is always looking for ways to expand her customer base.

### Posandi Bros.

Located on the shores of Breach Creek for more than five generations, this masonry business has provided most of the bricks for new construction in Improck for the past 50 years. Posandi Bros. is a family-owned business, and all of its employees are somehow connected to its titular clan, whether they’re direct scions, cousins, or have married into the family. Town councilor Quentino Posandi is the business’s owner and manager. As he’s often at town hall handling his duties, Posandi cousin Amera Lang (LE female human mason) currently administrates day-to-day duties. The family is notoriously tight-lipped about its business practices, and for good reason: the Posandis have been secret Asmodeus worshippers for generations. They often seek the guidance and aid of devils when they feel it’s necessary, sometimes even summoning them in their secret diabolic underground chambers.

### Quarters and Bits

This dual storefront is home on one side to a general store called Bits, and on the other, a weapon and armor smith called Quarters. From the outside, the businesses seem separate—until it becomes clear that both are the effort of proprietor Crink Twiddleton (CN male halfling merchant) a fast-talking halfling whose sales skills often see him selling outlandish items to customers who never knew how much they needed his wares. Crink is known for wearing a smart suit and a jaunty hat, and for having a mischievous twinkle in his eye, but beyond his cheesy charisma, he’s also known for importing some of the finest goods and employing several highly skilled smiths.

### Reliant Book Company

This niche retailer buys and sells rare tomes, though its selections are known for being rather stuffy and academic, ranging from ancient history texts to the personal diaries of long-dead heroes in myriad languages. Owner and secret necromancer Voz Lirayne (half-elf) runs this shop with the help of her new apprentice Calmont Trenault.

### Shelyn's Smile

This segmented building on Breach Creek is both the headquarters of Improck's artisan guild and a temple to Shelyn, goddess of art, beauty, love, and music. In one wing, the faithful worship the Eternal Rose through sculpture and painting classes as well as via choirs and orchestral performances, and priests offer healing to those in need. In the other wing, representatives for Improck's artisans and tradespeople are available on most days of the week, and customers can pay a small fee to be matched with the right proprietors for all their renovation, building, and decorating needs. Guild president Tarindlara Vallindel (NG female elf cleric of Shelyn 5) is an immaculate professional representative, the picture of sartorial splendor and class, and a prominent Shelynite herself.

### Tuskhead Stoneworking

A new venture in the last decade, Tuskhead Stoneworking does brisk business building limestone foundations and walkways, installing landscaping stonework, and carving gravestones. The business is known for importing large barges of quarried stone straight into its building on the banks of Imp Creek, and management’s strong relationship with the town council has ensured that all permit requests are readily approved. In recent years, however,

Tuskhead has poached a few prominent clients from the Posandi Bros. masonry company—a coup for owner Rorsk Axebane (LG male dwarf mason), who has always suspected that his rivals dabble in shady business practices. So far, the masonry company hasn’t turned its sights on Tuskhead, but when the Posandis eventually take notice, no doubt town councilor Quentino Posandi could make life difficult for the company.

### Vusker's Carts & Wheels

Located just inside the Breachill town limits, Vusker’s Carts & Wheels is the go-to wainwright for the many traveling merchants and adventuring caravans that pass through the town. Chief wainwright and business owner Fadelby Vusker (LN male human wainwright) is clever and hardworking, and he has built up a robust business from the small mom-and-pop store that his father opened just before he was born. He’s also a shrewd businessman, and when his customers return to him complaining that wayward bandits or roving monsters damaged their wagons, Vusker simply shrugs, charges them for repairs, and recommends that they petition the town council for adventurers to address any recurring dangers to themselves or other travelers. Occasionally, when a threat outside town has scared enough of his customers, Vusker himself quietly looks for heroes to help address the problem and keep the heat off his business affairs.

## Current Events



## History

Improck began with the humblest of origins, as a barely functional outpost of human refugees who suffered from amnesia, but the aid and mentorship of a powerful wizard led these shivering and dying unfortunates to found the hardy and thriving town that exists today.

The town predates its most notable landmark, which sits about 5 miles to the northeast, Citadel Altaerein, the foreboding but now-abandoned fortress that was once the home of the Hellknight Order. In years past, Improck gladly served as a supply source for the Hellknights, who commended the well-ordered peace the town enjoyed. But 8 years ago, when the Order fully retreated from Citadel Altaerein in favor of the order’s new home in Oshad, Improck's inhabitants simply shrugged, continuing the agriculture, crafting, and bartering that has always sustained them. Now, common wisdom generally recommends avoiding the citadel, which serves as an isolated haven for peaceful groups that don’t want to be disturbed but is also rumored to be overrun with dangerous monsters.

The order built its single-tower keep, Citadel Altaerein, high on a low-rising hill (now referred to as Hellknight hill) about 5 miles northeast of town.
