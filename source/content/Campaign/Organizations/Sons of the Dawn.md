## Overview

The Sons of the Dawn are an independent military organization dedicated to finding and rooting out evil and corruption "wherever it may be found". Their zeal in this endeavour often borders on the insane and makes them dangerous opponents. Their headquarters is the Fortress of the Light in the city of Narlon. Although Oshad has a king, the Children hold so much political and military power there that they are undoubtedly its true rulers. They consider the Kenay and any magic user evil.

Government: Theocratic military organisation;


## Current Events

[[Alinya Vilicus]] has been attacked by a few members of the organisation.
