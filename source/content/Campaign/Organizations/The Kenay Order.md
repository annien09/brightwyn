## Overview

Ardamin is ruled by the Seph, although the day-to-day bureaucracy is handled by a council of Kenay and civil administrators. The city is notable as the only place where the Kenay have wielded officialized administrative power since the Shining Crusade. The population of the city is roughly 500,000. It has remained independent of outside control for its entire existence, although it has suffered several major sieges and even direct assaults.

The Seph is the leader of the Kenay in the White Tower in Ardamin. Her full title is "The Seph, Watcher of the Seals, The Flame of Ardamin" but she is usually just referred to as the Seph. {redacted}

The Seph is the supreme authority among the Kenay. She is widely recognized as one of the most powerful women in the Brightwyn.
