## Current Events

Magistrate Stainton Drune — Public Information
Title: Magistrate of Civic Order
Position: Oversees civil law enforcement, neighborhood safety, and local investigations in Ilayas

**Demeanor:**

- Polished and articulate in public appearances
- Known for a sharp, analytical mind and a commanding courtroom presence
- Rarely seen without his court advisors or civic aides

**Known Responsibilities:**

Tasked with investigating the recent rise of mysterious deaths (often assumed to be shiver overdoses or dream-related incidents)
Works closely with the City Guard
Has coordinated with Arbiter Zenobia Zenderholm to treat all suspected shiver-related deaths as murder, placing responsibility on illegal shiver dealers

**Public Initiatives**:

Crackdown on the shiver trade in Ilayas, especially after the death of Frell Tann, the nephew of another magistrate
Has increased patrols and public health notices warning citizens about the risks of the “Nightmare Plague”
Launched city-funded investigations into connections between drug use and occult disturbances

**Public Perception:**

Opinions vary

Some view him as a hard-nosed defender of public order
Others (particularly Ilayas residents) see him as  politically motivated
Widely regarded as efficient, but not personally charitable or empathetic

**Notable Quotes in Circulation:**

“No one is above the law—not priest, prophet, or pauper.”
—Attributed to Magistrate Drune during a public hearing on unlawful seances in Bridgefront
## History

1. Aristocratic Origins (Known, Not Scandalous)
	Drune is from a minor noble family of Alonian descent—old money, not particularly influential, but deeply bureaucratic.
	His family has a tradition of civil service and law; his father was a registrar, and an aunt was an inquisitor for the city courts.
	He studied civic law and historical jurisprudence, notably publishing On the Sanctity of Public Ordinance—a dry but respected legal treatise.

2. Career Path
	Began his public career in zoning enforcement, where he was known for shutting down illegal gambling halls and alchemical labs.
	Rose in prominence during the Blood Veil Plague era (an infamous epidemic), advocating quarantines and authorizing forceful detainments of suspected shiver carriers.
	Was promoted to Magistrate of Civic Order after the plague, largely due to his reputation for calm amidst chaos.
