## Overview
The Sanctum of the Final Veil is a grand, imposing structure, its walls adorned with intricate carvings depicting the cycle of life and death.  The acolytes/Tharion Shane leads the party to the Hall of the Final Veil.

### Hall of the Final Veil

This solemn hall is where ceremonies – funerals or other kinds – take place. The chamber is adorned with veils that gently sway in an ethereal breeze. Clerics perform rites, offering prayers and soothing words to comfort grieving hearts, and guide departed souls to the River of Souls which takes them to Pharasma's Boneyard (a neutral plane where the souls of dead mortals from the Material Plane are judged by the goddess Pharasma.)

As the High Cleric prepares the room for the sacred oath-taking ceremony, the atmosphere is hallowed and reverent. The walls are adorned with Pharasma's intricate symbol, a representation of the goddess's dominion over birth, death, and fate. Candles flicker, casting dancing shadows, and incense wafts through the air, carrying with it a sense of divine presence.

The High Cleric herself is a figure of authority and piety, draped in ceremonial robes that billow gracefully as she moves. The fabric bears symbols associated with Pharasma, emphasizing her connection to the divine. Her demeanor is solemn yet compassionate, reflecting the gravity of the occasion.

### Short Prayer Before the Ceremony

Before the oath is sworn, the High Cleric gathers the assembled people and leads them in a short prayer and invocation. The atmosphere becomes charged with spiritual energy as the supplications resonate within the sacred walls.

Arioneth: "Oh, Lady of Graves, Pharasma, we gather in your sacred abode seeking your divine presence. As we stand on the precipice of this solemn ceremony, guide our hearts and minds. Bless this champion-to-be with the strength to face the darkness and the wisdom to discern the path of righteousness. Let your divine light shine upon us, now and forever."

### Presenting the Holy Text

To establish a connection with the divine, the High Cleric calls upon Isiril, who unveils a gilded box. From within, she retrieves a tome emanating a magical calming aura.

Arioneth: "In this gilded box lies a tome of divine knowledge, a beacon of Pharasma's teachings. Champion, unveil the sacred text, for through its pages, a bridge shall be forged between the mortal and the divine. May its magical aura instil tranquility and illuminate the path that our new champion is about to tread."

The room seems to still as the book is presented, symbolizing the conduit through which the divine connection will be forged between the character and the goddess.

### Isiril's Words on the Oath

Isiril, a paragon of virtue and strength, then comes to stand beside the character, serving as a living testament to the power and righteousness of those who serve Pharasma. She shares words on the significance of being a champion, recounting personal experiences of challenges and triumphs faced in service to the Lady of Graves.

Isiril: "Taking an oath to the Lady of Graves is not just a commitment; it is a sacred covenant that binds us to the very fabric of existence. To serve Pharasma is to stand as a beacon against the encroaching shadows, a defender of the natural order. I, too, stood at this crossroads, faced challenges that tested my mettle, and triumphed with the grace of the Lady. Know that your journey, though arduous, is blessed, for you shall walk with purpose and divine guidance."

### During the Oath-Taking

As the ceremony reaches its apex, the High Cleric takes charge, guiding the character through the beginning of the oath.

Arioneth: "Now, champion, as you stand before the altar of fate, let your voice resonate with purpose. Swear this sacred oath, binding your destiny to the eternal cycle. In the face of your vendetta against Orcus, let these words echo through the chambers of the Boneyard, resounding as a testament to your unwavering commitment. Speak, and let the Lady of Graves bear witness to the forging of a new champion in her name."

The words are carefully chosen, tailored to the character's personal vendetta against Orcus, weaving a narrative of dedication and purpose.

### Oath-Taking

As the character begins to recite the sacred oath, a palpable tension fills the room, almost as if the very air resonates with the weight of the words being spoken. The flickering candlelight casts dancing shadows, creating an ethereal ambiance that seems to amplify the significance of the moment. The sacred symbols adorning the walls shimmer with a divine glow, and the incense hangs in the air like a conduit connecting the mortal realm to the divine.

As the High Cleric guides the character through the oath, the room seems to hold its breath. The silence is punctuated only by the measured words of the oath, each syllable echoing with a resonance that feels both solemn and powerful. The other champion stands steadfast beside the character, their presence reinforcing the unity of purpose.

### Pharasma’s Omnipotence manifesting

As the character completes the oath, there is a subtle shift in the atmosphere. The very fabric of reality seems to ripple, and an otherworldly light bathes the room. A gentle, cool breeze, carrying with it the essence of the Boneyard, whispers through the temple. The symbols of Pharasma on the walls momentarily glow with a divine radiance.

Pharasma's omnipotence manifests in a quiet, profound manner. The room itself becomes a conduit for her gaze, a bridge connecting the mortal realm to the divine. Though invisible, there's a sense that the Lady of Graves herself is present, her attention fixed upon the sacred ceremony unfolding in her name. The magical aura of the holy text intensifies, serving as a conduit for the divine energy that now permeates the space.

### Blessing the new Champion

As the character concludes the oath, a surge of energy courses through them. It's not a physical sensation, but a profound spiritual awakening. In the stillness that follows, the High Cleric raises her hands once more, invoking the blessings of Pharasma upon the newly sworn champion.

The character may feel a gentle warmth enveloping them, a comforting presence that transcends the material world. It's as if a guiding hand reaches out from the divine, touching their soul with a sense of purpose and empowerment. In this moment, the character is both an individual and a vessel of divine will, blessed by Pharasma to carry out their sacred duty.

The temple, for a fleeting moment, seems to exist beyond the confines of time and space, bathed in the glow of the goddess's favor. The aura of sanctity lingers, imprinting upon the character's very being as they emerge from the oath-taking, forever marked as a champion of Pharasma.
