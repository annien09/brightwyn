## **The Forgotten Tomb**
	As the players decide to venture down the hidden path leading to the glade, they find themselves immersed in a world of untamed beauty and mystery. The narrow trail winds its way through the dense underbrush, the foliage pressing in on all sides like curious onlookers eager to reveal their secrets.

	The forest seems to close in around them, the canopy overhead casting the path into shadow as shafts of sunlight filter through the dense foliage. The air is cool and damp, heavy with the scent of earth and moss, punctuated by the occasional chirp of hidden creatures and the rustle of leaves in the breeze.
	
	The path twists and turns unpredictably, leading the players deeper into the heart of the forest with each step. Roots protrude from the forest floor like gnarled fingers, threatening to trip the unwary traveler, while tangled vines hang from the trees like curtains drawn across the path.
	
	As they journey deeper into the forest, the players can't shake the feeling that they are being watched, as if unseen eyes are following their every move. Yet, with determination in their hearts and curiosity driving them forward, they continue along the hidden path and you start hearing running water, like the sounds of a small river or a creek. 
	
	As the players emerge from the dense undergrowth, they find themselves standing in the heart of the hidden glade, a place steeped in both beauty and mystery. Before them lie the remnants of a forgotten place in the world, reclaimed by nature and shrouded in the embrace of time.

1. **The Ancient Stones**: Massive stones rise from the forest floor, their weathered surfaces bearing the weight of centuries. Carved with intricate symbols and runes, hinting at the rituals and ceremonies that once took place within the glade.
    
2. **The Overgrown Statues**: Two statues stand sentinel at the edge of the clearing, their forms partially obscured by creeping vines and moss. One depicts a female mage, her outstretched hands crackling with arcane energy, while the other portrays a dwarven warrior, his axe raised in a defiant stance. Despite the passage of time, their features remain remarkably well-preserved, a testament to the craftsmanship of their creators.
    
3. **The Forgotten Tents**: As you approach, you also see remnants of forgotten tents, their fabric tattered and torn, their frames bent and broken. Nature has begun to reclaim these makeshift shelters, with vines and ivy snaking their way through the fabric and moss creeping up the weathered poles.
	As the players approach the skeleton lying amidst the forgotten tents, they can't help but feel a sense of solemnity wash over them. The figure is clad in weathered leather armor, its surface cracked and worn with age. A rusted axe lies nearby, its blade dulled by time and neglect. It's clear that this unfortunate soul met a tragic end in this secluded glade.
	As the players ponder the significance of the letter, their attention is drawn to a curious object lying beside the skeleton: a white marble funerary baton, its surface smooth and unblemished despite the passage of time. Upon closer inspection, they realize that the baton is more than just a simple piece of stone—it's a key of some sort, its intricate carvings hinting at a hidden purpose.

Upon closer inspection, the players discover a weathered backpack slung over the skeleton's shoulders. Inside, they find a collection of mundane items, including a few scraps of dried rations, a waterskin long emptied of its contents, and a tattered bedroll.

However, nestled within the inner pocket of the leather jacket, they uncover a fragile piece of parchment, its edges yellowed with age. Carefully unfolding it, they find themselves holding an old letter, its faded ink barely legible after years of exposure to the elements.
    
4. **The Stone Circle**: At the center of the glade lies a circle of weathered stones, their surfaces worn smooth by the passage of time. Eight pillars stand at intervals around the perimeter, their tops adorned with faded runes and symbols. Despite their age, the stones remain standing.
    As the players explore the weathered pillars surrounding the stone circle, their eyes catch sight of faded symbols and intricate carvings etched into the stone surfaces. Despite the ravages of time and the encroaching elements, the remnants of a family crest can be discerned, its once-proud design now obscured by cracks and weathering.
    The crest depicts a shield adorned with symbols of lineage and heritage, though many of the details have been worn away by centuries of exposure to the elements. Bits of ivy and moss cling to the crevices of the stone, further obscuring the intricate carvings and adding to the sense of mystery and intrigue.
    Though the crest remains partially hidden and fragmented, the players can still make out certain elements—a lion rampant, a fleur-de-lis, and a motto that reads: "For Honor, Valor, and the Eternal Flame". (House Adellas)
5. **The Tomb and Braziers**: In the center of the stone circle stands a solitary tomb, its stone surface worn and weathered by the elements. Three inactive braziers surround it, their flames long extinguished, yet their presence still casting a sense of solemnity and reverence over the scene. It's clear that this tomb holds significance, though its true purpose remains shrouded in mystery.
	As the players approach the solitary tomb at the center of the stone circle, their attention is drawn to the imposing figure of the coffin within. Carved from weathered stone and adorned with ancient symbols, the coffin bears the unmistakable emblem of a medusa—a fearsome creature with snakes for hair, its gaze said to turn any who meet its eyes to stone.
	The medusa symbol is intricately detailed, its serpentine form winding sinuously across the surface of the coffin. Though the passage of time has worn away some of its finer details, the emblem still retains an aura of malevolence and power.
	Upon closer inspection, the players notice something unusual about the mouth of the coffin. Set into the stone is a recessed indentation, shaped like a large keyhole. As they examine the keyhole more closely, the players realize that it's not just any ordinary lock—it's designed to accommodate a large, ornate key, perhaps one with a specific shape or design. An examination of the hole in the medusa’s mouth reveals that it seems to match the tip of the funerary baton (Tomb of the Iron Medusa). 

The iron carving radiates strong transmutation magic. If the PCs insert the funerary baton into the hole, a loud metallic “click” sounds and the metal covering the medusa’s eyes slides back, exposing eyes made of polished white marble, with painted black pupils glaring menacingly. By rotating the funerary baton, the PCs turn the eyes in their metal sockets. When the eyes are crossed, the medusa’s jaws gape open and a cold blue light shines forth. The creature that turned the baton and all other creatures within a 5-foot spread are lifted off their feet and sucked into the yawning mouth, shrinking and spiraling down to nothingness as the iron face seems to swallow the targets whole. Despite the dramatic appearance, this is a teleportation effect
that can be resisted with a DC 25 Will save.

Without a funerary baton, a character can activate one of these medusa heads with a DC 25 Use Magic Device check made as a full-round action.

>[!info]- Adellas Family
>The notorious Alonian aristocrats of House Adella died out nearly two hundred years ago. After rising to prominence during the crusade against the Whispering Tyrant, the Adellas were especially famous for their contributions to the Grand Campaign against the undead armies. Known to produce scions with extraordinary talent for swordplay and sorcery, the house grew in influence, wealth, and notoriety before collapsing under the weight of its own arrogance in the 46th century ar. The Adellas were so despised by the time of their demise that all public record of the family was stricken from imperial annals, and anyone tainted by its blood was stripped of aristocratic status.

>[!info]- Warding Magic
> As the players utilize their magical abilities to detect magic within the underground necropolis, they find themselves enveloped in a swirl of potent transmutation energies that permeate the very fabric of the complex. The air crackles with arcane power, and their senses are inundated with the subtle vibrations of magic that pulse and thrum through the surrounding stone and earth. The tomb and the entire necropolis radiates with a powerful aura of transmutation magic, warding area within from scrying and magical observation. This effect creates a shimmering barrier that shields the necropolis from prying eyes, rendering it invisible to divination spells and effects.

>[!info]- Stone Doors
>Stone Doors: All doors in the necropolis consist of large rectangular stones that bear no obvious method of opening. Each side of the doors bears a carved medusa head of varying design. If an open palm is placed against such a carving, the stone block descends into the ground over the course of a full round, after which passage through the portal is possible. These doors remain open for 5 minutes, after which the door slides shut in a single round.

### Crematorium Entry
This dull gray granite building looms in the centre of the necropolis. Its entrance has a domed ceiling that rises to a height of twenty feet, and is decorated with intricate geometric designs. In the centre of the chamber’s floor, a carved medusa crest stares endlessly upward. To the north, a pair of stained-glass windows depicting a handsome man and a beautiful woman look on. A motto engraved around the circumference of the medusa engraving on the floor reads, “A Blade Answers Even the Most Vexing Question.” The antechamber to the north is empty, the stained-glass windows depict Aroden and Arazni as they appeared while they were human. 
### Crematorium 
The walls of this domed and oval-shaped formal chamber are covered in complex geometric patterns of green and gold. It appears to be used for funerary rites, with marble statue that hold tables at their feet. To the west, the wall is made up of a stained glass window that allows for view underneath.

As the players cautiously enter the crematorium room, they are met with a stifling wave of heat that washes over them, suffusing the chamber with an oppressive atmosphere. The air is thick with the scent of smoke, and the dim light of flickering torches casts eerie shadows across the walls.

>Suddenly, from the depths of the infernal pit at the centre of the room, a rumbling growl reverberates through the chamber, followed by the sound of shifting earth and crackling flames. With a burst of fiery energy, one towering figures emerges from the flames, a noble efreeti named Bebulec, their forms wreathed in flickering fire and molten lava.

>"Foolish mortals, you dare trespass?" he bellows, his voice tinged with madness. "You will pay for the sins of your ancestors! Prepare to face the fury of Bebulec the Unbound!"

>With a ferocious roar, the fire elementals and Bebulec launch themselves at the players, their attacks fueled by centuries of pent-up anger and resentment. 

As the players approach the northern wall of the crematorium room, they find themselves standing before three solemn shrines, each one a testament to the reverence and devotion of those who once inhabited this place. Despite the passage of time and the ravages of neglect, the shrines remain remarkably well-preserved, their surfaces adorned with intricate carvings and symbols that speak of ancient rituals and ceremonies.

1. **Shrine of the Flame**: The first shrine is dedicated to the element of fire, its surface adorned with images of flickering flames and dancing embers. At the centre of the shrine stands a small altar, upon which rests a burning brazier that casts a warm, comforting glow across the chamber. Surrounding the altar are offerings of incense and dried herbs, their fragrant smoke rising upwards in a swirling spiral towards the heavens.
    
2. **Shrine of the Earth**: The second shrine pays homage to the element of earth, its stone surface etched with images of towering mountains and sprawling landscapes. At the heart of the shrine lies a small basin filled with rich, fertile soil, symbolising the bounty and abundance of the earth. Sprigs of fresh greenery and wildflowers adorn the edges of the basin, their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the muted tones of the stone surroundings.
    
3. **Shrine of the Ancients**: The third shrine is a testament to the ancient rituals and traditions of those who once dwelled within the necropolis. Carved into the stone surface are images of hooded figures and arcane symbols, their meaning shrouded in mystery. At the centre of the shrine stands a weathered tome, its pages yellowed with age and bound in cracked leather. 
    


### Shrines 
As the players venture deeper into the necropolis, they come across two imposing chambers, each dominated by a large ornate tomb at its centre. The tombs are constructed from solid stone, their surfaces adorned with intricate carvings and symbols that speak of the wealth and power of those interred within.

1. **Chamber of the Fallen Lord**: In the first chamber, the players find themselves standing before a massive stone tomb, its surface polished to a gleaming sheen. At each corner of the tomb stands a statue of a knight, their stoic visages watching over the chamber with silent vigilance. Each knight is surrounded by a circle of magic runes etched into the stone floor, their faint glow casting a soft light across the chamber.

The tomb itself is adorned with images of battle and conquest, depicting scenes of heroic deeds and valiant warriors locked in combat. Intricate carvings adorn the surface of the tomb, depicting the heraldry and sigils of the noble house to which the fallen lords belonged.

2. As the players enter the second chamber, they are met with a scene vastly different from the first. At the centre of the chamber lies a massive stone tomb, much like the one in the previous room, but this one is adorned with symbols and carvings that speak of grace and elegance. The tomb itself is surrounded by a circle of magic etched into the stone floor, its intricate runes pulsating with a faint, ominous glow.

However, what sets this chamber apart is the presence of six pipes, three on each side of the room, emerging from the stone construction beneath the tomb. These pipes are connected to a complex network of machinery hidden beneath the chamber, their metal surfaces perfectly preserved. Faint wisps of *noxious* gas escape from the pipes, filling the air with a sickly, acrid odor that burns the nostrils and stings the eyes.

The circle of magic underneath the tomb perpetually activates the machinery beneath, causing the pipes to emit the noxious fumes into the chamber at regular intervals. The gas fills the room quickly, swirling around the tomb and obscuring it from view with a thick, choking haze.


### Sepulchers 
As the players enter the first sepulcher room, they are met with a sight of opulence and grandeur. The room is lined with eight imposing stone enclosed tombs, each one adorned with elaborate carvings and intricate designs that speak of wealth and nobility. The tombs gleam with polished stone and precious metals, their surfaces reflecting the dim torchlight in a dazzling display of luxury.

These tombs are clearly reserved for the wealthy and esteemed members of the family, their names and titles engraved into the stone for all to see.  Enchanted golden censers hang from the walls, filling the air with the faint scent of incense, while jeweled offerings are scattered across the floor, glinting in the flickering light.

In contrast, the second sepulcher room presents a starkly different scene. Here, the tombs are simpler in design, constructed from plain stone and devoid of the lavish embellishments found in the first room. The air is heavy with the scent of ancient herbs and spices.

These tombs are reserved for the servants and retainers of the family, their mummified remains wrapped in linen and laid to rest with simple offerings at their feet. Though their names may have been lost to time, their presence in the chamber is a testament to their loyalty and dedication to those they served in life.


### The Chamber of Dark Reflections

As the players follow the path from the sepulcher rooms, they find themselves entering a new chamber. At the centre of the room lies a large magic circle, its intricate runes etched into the stone floor pulsating with energy. Within the circle, a pentagram is inscribed, its lines drawn with precision, and at its centre rests a gleaming dagger, its blade shimmering with an otherworldly sheen.

Surrounding the magic circle is a fountain, its waters dark and viscous, like blood thickened with age. Skulls adorn the edges of the fountain, their empty eye sockets staring hollowly into the depths below. The liquid within the fountain seems to pulse with a life of its own, swirling and churning as if possessed by some unseen force.

The air in the chamber is heavy with a sense of dread and unease, and the players can't help but feel a chill run down their spines as they gaze upon the macabre scene before them. It's clear that this chamber holds dark secrets and ancient rituals that are best left undisturbed.

>As the players cautiously explore the chamber, their eyes scan the surroundings for any clues or markings that might reveal the chamber's purpose or significance. Amidst the flickering torchlight and eerie shadows, they notice a faint inscription etched into the stone floor near the entrance of the room. Drawing closer, they make out the words carved into the stone, illuminated by the dim glow of their torches. The inscription reads: "Welcome to the Chamber of Dark Reflections."

>As the players approach the magic circle, they can sense the raw power that emanates from it, tingling along their skin and sending shivers down their spines. The dagger at the centre of the pentagram seems to call out to them, its blade whispering promises of forbidden knowledge and untold power. Yet, as tempting as it may be to investigate further, the players can't shake the feeling that they are treading on dangerous ground. The chamber exudes an aura of dark and malevolent magic, and they know that to disturb the delicate balance of power within could unleash forces beyond their comprehension. With caution and trepidation, they steel themselves for whatever secrets the chamber may hold, knowing that they tread a perilous path into the unknown.

> **Impending Doom**: Anyone who enters the radius of the magic circle begins to feel a growing sense of unease and dread, as if unseen eyes are watching their every move and malevolent whispers echo in the depths of their mind.

This aura of fear intensifies the longer one remains within the room, causing their heart to race and their breath to quicken as irrational thoughts of danger and doom fill their thoughts. Even the bravest of adventurers find themselves succumbing to the insidious influence of the magic, their nerves fraying and their resolve weakening in the face of an unseen threat.

#### Dagger Effects 
Upon touching the dagger, the player is enveloped in a shroud of darkness, their senses overwhelmed by a suffocating blackness that seems to seep into their very soul. They are plunged into a nightmarish dreamscape where their deepest fears and insecurities are laid bare before them.


**Nezoh's nightmare**

As Nezoh steps into the nightmarish dreamscape, he finds himself standing on the edge of a vast crater, the earth scorched and blackened by some unseen force. In the centre of the crater lies the lifeless form of Eddval, his body broken and mangled, surrounded by a ring of smoldering ashes. Nezoh's former girlfriend, Kaya, kneels beside Eddval's body, her face contorted with grief and anguish. Tears stream down her cheeks as she clutches his lifeless form to her chest, her cries echoing in the silence of the night.

As Nezoh approaches, Kaya's grief turns to anger, her eyes flashing with a fierce intensity as she turns her accusing gaze upon him. "This is your fault," she screams, her voice raw with emotion. "You promised to protect him, and you failed. You left him alone, and now he's dead because of you."

Nezoh feels overwhelmed by a sense of guilt and remorse as ge realises the full extent of his failure. He had promised to keep Eddval safe, to protect him from harm, but in his quest for wealth, he had abandoned him to his fate. The weight of the betrayal bears down upon him like a leaden weight, crushing his spirit and filling him with a profound sense of sorrow and regret. He sees himself reach out to Kaya to offer some small comfort in her time of need, but she recoils from his touch, her grief turning to bitterness and resentment.


### Medusa's room

In the final room, the air is thick with a palpable sense of dread, heavy with the weight of ancient power and dark magics. Two blood fountains stand sentinel at opposite ends of the chamber, their crimson waters flowing endlessly into shallow pools at their feet. The metallic tang of blood mingles with the scent of decay fill the room. Between the fountains stand two statues, their stony visages frozen in expressions of agony and despair. 

In the centre of the chamber, surrounded by a swirling aura of magic, stands an ornate statue of a medusa. Carved from polished stone, the statue depicts the mythical creature in all her terrible beauty, her serpentine hair writhing and twisting as if alive. She stands upon a raised pedestal, her gaze fixed upon some unseen horizon, her expression both captivating and terrifying in its intensity.

As the players gaze upon the ornate statue, a shiver runs down their spines as they feel a subtle shift in the air. The swirling aura of magic surrounding the statue seems to intensify, casting eerie shadows that dance and flicker across its polished surface. Suddenly, with a low, rumbling groan, the stone begins to crack and crumble, revealing the flesh beneath. Piece by piece, the statue's stony exterior gives way to supple skin, its features coming to life with a lifelike realism. First, the statue's eyes flicker open, twin orbs of emerald fire that seem to pierce through the darkness with their intense gaze. Then, her lips part in a revealing rows of razor-sharp fangs that gleam in the dim light.

As the transformation continues, the medusa's serpentine hair begins to writhe and twist, each snake coming to life with a hiss of fury. They slither and coil around her head, their forked tongues flicking out to taste the air. Finally, with a triumphant sigh, the medusa steps down from her pedestal, her movements fluid and graceful as she stalks towards the players. Her eyes burn with a fierce intensity.

>[!read aloud]+
> As the medusa ([[Lysandra]]) steps down from her pedestal, she looks at all of you in turn. 'Welcome, newcomers,' she hisses, her voice carrying a haunting melody that seems to echo through the chamber. 'I sense your presence within these sacred halls. What brings you to this ancient sanctum? Speak, and perhaps we may find common cause. It's been so long since I last had company.'

##### Helping the Adellas 
Lysandra's involvement in the rise of House Adellas from humble origins as common soldiers to the heights of Alonian nobility is a tale woven with threads of cunning, ambition, and strategic brilliance.

In the early days of their ascent, House Adella faced numerous challenges as they sought to establish themselves within the cutthroat world of Alonian society. Despite their lack of noble lineage, they possessed qualities that set them apart from their peers: loyalty, unyielding determination, and a fierce commitment to excellence in all endeavors.

Recognising the potential within Marcus Junius Adellas and his family, Lysandra forged an alliance with them, leveraging her own influence and connections to help propel them forward on their path to greatness. With her keen insight into the intricacies of Alonian politics and her mastery of manipulation and intrigue, she guided House Adellas through the treacherous waters of courtly intrigue and rivalries, helping them navigate the challenges they faced with skill and cunning.

Lysandra's support proved invaluable as House Adella distinguished themselves on the battlefield, earning renown and accolades for their bravery and skill in combat. She even helped them secure key alliances and a marriage within the Teseon society, paving the way for their eventual elevation to nobility. And that's when Marcus Junius decided to betray and imprison her "in this gods forsaken tomb", because she knew too much, she solely knew of their actual origins and the fact that they weren't on noble birth.

"I have languished within these walls for centuries, trapped by this treachery," the voice hisses, its words dripping with venomous spite. "They thought to banish me to this tomb, to confine me to this wretched existence for all eternity. But now, with your arrival, there is a chance for revenge, a chance to break free from these accursed chains and reclaim what is rightfully mine."

The medusa's tone turns persuasive, her voice softening with a hint of cunning as she continues, "You hold the key to my freedom, mortal ones. I know that you possess the means to release me from this prison, to open the path that will lead me back to the world above. And I offer you something in return, something that you desire above all else. **Wealth, power, knowledge**, the choice is yours. But know this: if you aid me in my quest for freedom, you shall be richly rewarded. Think on it, mortal ones, and choose wisely."
